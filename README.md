# Bash-shell-scripts

Bash shell scripts used to automatize chemoinformatics tasks.

Most scripts handle the Protein Data Bank (PDB) format which provides a standard representation for 
macromolecular structure data derived from X-ray diffraction and NMR studies. 
This representation was created in the 1970's and a large amount of software using it has been written.
