# Bash-shell-scripts

The bash shell scripts uploaded here, were written and used by me to automatize chemoinformatics tasks. I do not consider myself a programmer. In fact, most of these scripts were my first contact with coding and the linux environment. 

Usually I wrote Shell scripts to handle Protein Data Bank (PDB) format files which provides a standard representation for 
macromolecular structure data derived from X-ray diffraction and NMR studies.
